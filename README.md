# SEA-pop-growth-2001-2010
Average annual population growth of countries in South East Asia from 2001 to 2010 in QGIS

# How to Use
The scale for average annual population growth rates is done in 1% increments from 0%. Some districts have growth rates much higher than 5% but it would obscure the data from other districts to break it down further. There is no district level population growth data from Thailand, Singapore and Brunei.

Please feel free to use the compiled shape files and data for the region for your own analysis!
